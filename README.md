## 📋 Overview

This project provides a robust solution for scraping web data and processing it efficiently. It uses a blend of requests for multi-threaded data fetching and playwright for dynamic interactions with web pages, making it ideal for handling complex scraping tasks. The data processing part is finely tuned to work with large datasets efficiently, providing quick insights and outputs in various formats.

## 🌟 Features

- Dynamic Web Scraping: Utilizes playwright to interact with JavaScript-heavy websites dynamically.
- Multi-threaded Requests: Employs requests library in a multi-threaded setup to speed up the data fetching process.
- Efficient Data Processing: Leverages pandas and numpy for data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
- Automated Data Collection: Scripts that automate the collection of data periodically, ensuring fresh data is always available.
- Customizable Outputs: Provides functionality to export data into CSV, JSON, or directly into databases.

## 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- pandas
- numpy
- playwright
- requests

## 🔧 Installation

### Ubuntu
First, install the OS dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libvpx7 libevent-2.1-7 libopus0 libgstreamer1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 libharfbuzz-icu0 libhyphen0 libmanette-0.2-0 libflite1 libgles2 woff2 libgstreamer-gl1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-libav
playwright install
```

Then continue with cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhmmdbdrhmd/TikTokInsightsScraper.git
cd TikTokInsightsScraper
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv tiktok --python=python3.10
source tiktok/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mac OS:

- Install Homebrew if not already installed: ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" ```

```zsh
brew install libvpx libevent opus gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly gst-libav
playwright install
```

Then continue with cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/mhmmdbdrhmd/TikTokInsightsScraper.git
cd TikTokInsightsScraper
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```zsh
virtualenv tiktok --python=python3.10
source tiktok/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary Python dependencies:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ✅ Tested Platforms

This application has been thoroughly tested on the following operating systems:
- macOS (latest stable release)
- Ubuntu (latest LTS release)

This ensures compatibility and performance on these popular platforms, accommodating a broad range of use cases and environments.


## 🚀 Usage

To run the script with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```
To customize the scraping and processing:
```bash
python main.py --days 10 --pages https://www.tiktok.com/@infinityhoop https://www.tiktok.com/@anotherpage --target_eye 50 20000 150 600000 700 --target_star 30 10000 200 300000 400
```
- --days: Number of days to fetch data for (default: 7).
- --pages: TikTok pages to scrape.
- --target_eye & --target_star: Set targets for different metrics like Posts, Likes, Comments, Plays, and Saves.

## 🎨 How It Works

1. Initialization: Set up the URLs and parameters for the scraping.
2. Web Scraping:
   - playwright: Handles dynamic pages, simulating user interactions to fetch data rendered by JavaScript.
   - requests: Manages multiple threads to fetch data from API endpoints or simpler HTML pages.
3. Data Processing:
   - Data is processed and transformed using pandas, with the results being saved into a detailed Google Sheet, which includes comprehensive analytics on emoji usage, engagement metrics, and more.
4. Output:
   - The final output is a Google Sheet which provides a granular view of data metrics by emoji, showing both actual values and predefined targets.

## 📊 Output

The script generates a comprehensive `Final.xlsx` file that includes several sheets, each dedicated to different types of emoji-related data metrics such as Likes, Comments, Plays, and Saves. Each sheet not only provides detailed figures but also comparative graphs that illustrate actual values against predetermined targets for both "Eye" and "Star" emojis:

- **Data Sheet**: Raw data collected from TikTok.
- **Posts Summary**: Total number of posts per emoji and comparison to target.

- **Likes Summary**: Total likes per emoji and comparison to target.
